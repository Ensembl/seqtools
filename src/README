==============================================================
WELCOME TO THE SEQTOOLS PACKAGE

This package is aimed at those involved in genome annotation 
and contains tools for detailed analysis of sequences/alignments.

==============================================================


THE TOOLS
---------

blixem - A program for viewing multiple alignments against a reference sequence. It displays an overview showing where alignments and exons/introns lie on the reference sequence, and a detailed view showing the actual nucleotides or peptides in the sequences, color-coded to indicate how well they match.  Gapped alignments are supported and other features such as SNPs and polyA tails can also be displayed.

blixemh - The same as blixem but with additional functionality for fetching sequences via HTTP.

dotter - A dot-matrix program that plots two sequences against each other, one vertically and one horizontally, drawing a dot wherever the bases match.  Noise is filtered out, so that alignments appear as diagonal lines.



INSTALLATION
------------

Supported platforms are Linux and Mac OS X.

To install this package in the default location (usually /usr/bin), type the following commands on a command line:

./configure
make all
make install

To install in a different location (e.g. if you do not have root privileges for the default location), use the --prefix argument with ./configure.  For example, the following would install the programs in the directory /foo/bar:

./configure --prefix=/foo/bar
make all
make install



DEPENDENCIES
------------

This section describes what to do if the installation fails due to missing dependencies.


GTK and GLib
------------
The SeqTools programs require the GTK and GLib libraries to be installed on your system.  The configure script will give an error if these libraries are not found.  If they are installed but are in a different location to the default pkg-config directory, then you may need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to tell pkg-config to look in that path.

If you have more than one version of these libraries on your system, you may also need to use the -rpath linker option to force the program to use the correct version.  The -rpath option can be specified using the LDFLAGS enviroment variable.  If your program is using an incorrect version of one of these libraries, you will probably see errors about missing GTK or GLib functions when you try to run the program.

For example:

./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/my/dir/lib/pkgconfig LDFLAGS="-Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /my/dir/lib"


libcurl
-------
blixemh also requires the libcurl library to be installed on your system - "make all" will fail if it is not found.

Firstly, if you do not require the facility to fetch sequences using HTTP, then you can use blixem instead of blixemh.  After running "make all", run the following commands to install blixem (and, if required, dotter), without installing blixemh:

make blixem
make dotter
make install

If you do require the HTTP functionality, you need to install the development version of the libcurl library.  For example, on Debian this can be installed as follows:

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
