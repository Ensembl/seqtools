exec belvu -z '=' -C -o MSF ../data/PF02171_seed_separator.stock

# Description:
#   Read in an alignment that has a separator of '='
#   between the sequence name and coords. Save the 
#   alignment without saving coords so that we know
#   the coords have been stripped from the name correctly
#   Also tests saving without coords in MSF format.
