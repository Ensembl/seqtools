exec dotter -q 246634 -f ../data/chr4_protein_align.gff ../data/chr4_ref_seq.fasta ../data/Q9H8G1.fasta 

#
# Description:
#   Test Dotter in nucleotide->protein mode. Tests the dot-matrix calculation as well
#   as the display of transcripts and HSPs supplied via a features file.
#
# Results:
#   Dotter's graphical display should start up, showing a dot-plot where strong matching regions
#   between the two sequences are shown as diagonal lines. The greyramp tool can be used to adjust
#   the contrast of the dot plot. Transcripts from the features file should be shown along the
#   horizontal axis and HSPs from the features file can be displayed by enabling the relevant
#   option in the View menu (note that HSPs on both strands of the reference sequence are shown,
#   but the pixelmap will only draw matches against the forward strand in protein mode).
