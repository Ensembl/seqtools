#
# Description:
#   Tests calling Dotter on a long sequence versus itself. Transcripts are supplied via a features
#   file.
#
# Results:
#   Dotter's graphical display should start up, showing a dot-plot where strong matching regions
#   between the two sequences are shown as diagonal lines: since the two sequences match exactly, 
#   there will be a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner. Any other matching
#   regions (i.e. internal repeats) will also display as diagonal lines.
#
#   Transcripts from the features file should be shown along both axes.
