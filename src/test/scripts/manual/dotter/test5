exec dotter -q 246634 -v -H -f ../data/chr4_dna_align.gff ../data/chr4_ref_seq.fasta ../data/DA730641.fasta

#
# Description:
#   Test Dotter in nucleotide->nucleotide mode, using the reverse-complemented version of the input
#   match sequence. Also tests starting up in HSP mode.
#
# Results:
#   Dotter starts up showing HSPs. Enable the pixelmap from the View menu to see if the alignments
#   in the calculated dot-plot match the positions of the HSPs. The pixelmap and the HSPs show 
#   matches from the (reverse-complemented) match sequence against both strands of the reference
#   sequence.
