#
# Description:
#   Tests loading a dot-matrix plot from file for a long sequence versus itself.
#
# Results:
#   Dotter's graphical display should start up, showing the dot-plot. It should start
#   almost instantly - much quicker than the same test where the plot is calculated
#   from the input sequences (test2). You should be able to interact with the plot as
#   if it were created from the original sequences, including being able to change
#   the contrast using the greyramp tool.
