Belvu tests

This directory contains some tests that can be used to test the basic functionality for Belvu. The tests are not extensive, particularly for graphical functions, but they are a good starting point. There are also some manual tests described in src/doc/Design_notes/testing.ods.

The directory contents are:
- data: contains the input files for the tests
- command_line: contains tests that can be run on the command line. The program output on stdout for, say, test1, should match the recorded results in test1_results. The intent is that these tests can be automated at some point.
- gui: contains graphical tests, e.g. for checking that colors are displayed correctly.

Note that the tests must be run from the folder that contains them, because they use a relative path to look for the input files.
