  <h1>Functional specification</h1>
  <p>We don't have a formal functional specification for the SeqTools programs; instead, required behaviours are defined by means of a test plan, which specifies a set of testable actions and their expected outcomes.  The test plan is an OpenOffice spreadsheet.  To get a general overview of program behaviour, see the user documentation.</p>
