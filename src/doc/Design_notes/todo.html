  <h2>Outstanding issues</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you change the range in Dotter and the crosshair is outside the new range, the crosshair should be moved so that is inside the new range.  Currently it is incorrectly displayed out of bounds.
      <li>Dotter should show exons for the vertical sequence (on the RHS of the display).
      <li>Allow to bump exons in Dotter.
      <li>Variations: expand the variations track to multiple lines if variations overlap?
      <li>When running Dotter from Blixem, we should report if Dotter fails to start.
      <li>Need to implement printing for Dotter and Blixem.
      <li>Dotter should support the -N option, similarly to Blixem. Blixem should pass this arg.
      <li>When calling Dotter on a sequence vs itself, it crashes if you change the range of the horizontal sequence.
      <li>When calling Dotter on a sequence vs itself where there are concatenated sequences in the input file, it should display separator lines between the sequences.
      <li>Re-enable feature-series?
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Feature requests</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>When running Dotter on a large range it takes a long time to start up and there is no indication that anything is happening; it would be good to have a status bar of some description, and a cancel button.

    </ul>
