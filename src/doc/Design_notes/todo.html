  <h1>To do</h1>
  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variations: the variations track is experimental code and will need to be improved, in particular in its handling of overlapping features.
      <li>Feature-series: this functionality was disabled when Blixem and Dotter were re-written at version 4. We should consider whether this is still a useful feature and, if so, whether to use the original SFS file format or to switch to GFF.  The SFS file format is documented here: http://sfixem.sbc.su.se/SFS_desc.html
      <li>Multiple row selections: using the up/down arrow keys to move the row selection doesn't always work if there are adjacent rows from the same match sequence.
      <li>Dotter does not display dots in a sliding-window sized margin at edges of the dot-plot, even if bases are exactly aligned. This is confusing to the users so the dot-plot should be clipped so as not to show the space where the dots cannot be calculated.
      <li>DNA search: this currently just jumps to the start of the DNA section that was found; we should also highlight the found DNA in the reference sequence.
      <li>Printing: the pfetch window should have a print option.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Enhancements</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>It would be nice to be able to view the sequence data for an insertion (a vertical yellow line in a match sequence) in Blixem, e.g. by hovering over it with the mouse.
      <li>Bump exons: add the facility to bump exons in Dotter.
      <li>Sorting exons: exons in the big picture Blixem should be sorted in the same order as those in the detail-view.
      <li>Selecting exons: when you click on an exon in the exon view in Blixem (when bumped), the exon should be selected.
      <li>When you hover over an exon in the exon view in Blixem (when bumped), it would be nice if info about the exon were shown in the toolbar feedback area.
      <li>When running Dotter on a large range it takes a long time to start up and there is no indication that anything is happening; it would be good to have a status bar of some description, and a cancel button. When running from Blixem, we should report if Dotter fails to start.
      <li>When calling Dotter from Blixem, start Dotter with the crosshair placed at the currently-selected coords in Blixem (if applicable).
      <li>If you hit the boundary of one sequence when moving along a diagonal in Dotter and continue to press the movement keys (,.[]), then it stops moving on the one sequence but continues to move along the other, i.e. it goes off the diagonal. It would be nicer if it stopped moving altogether.
      <li>Cosmetic: the %ID labels on the big picture grid should be right-aligned.
      <li>Button tooltips: the zoom buttons in the big-picture should have tooltips.
    </ul>
