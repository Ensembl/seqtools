  <h1>To do</h1>
  <h2>Outstanding issues</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dotter should show exons for the vertical sequence (on the RHS of the display).
      <li>Allow to bump exons in Dotter.
      <li>Variations: expand the variations track in Blixem to multiple lines if variations overlap?
      <li>When running Dotter from Blixem, we should report if Dotter fails to start.
      <li>Need to implement printing for Dotter and Blixem.
      <li>When calling Dotter on a sequence vs itself where there are concatenated sequences in the input file, it should display separator lines between the sequences.
      <li>Re-enable feature-series?
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Feature requests</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>When running Dotter on a large range it takes a long time to start up and there is no indication that anything is happening; it would be good to have a status bar of some description, and a cancel button.

    </ul>
  </p>
