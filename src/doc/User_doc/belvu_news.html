<h1>Belvu - Release History</h1>

  <h3>4.5</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the last column not being fully shown.</li>
    <li>Made sure all terminal messages are terminated with a line break.</li>
    <li>Added BELVU_STATUSBAR_SIZE environment variable to allow the statusbar to have a different font size to the main window. Alternatively, set this to zero to hide the statusbar.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where the fetch and annotations windows were not using the font size specified by BELVU_FONT_SIZE.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>4.4</h3>
  <p>Belvu's graphical user interface has been re-vamped.  The changes are mostly cosmetic and should be intuitive, although there are a few points worth noting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The functionality to left-click a menu to get a default action has been removed; left- or right-clicking a menu will now always show the drop-down menu.  The default left-click actions have been moved to a toolbar adjacent to the menu; hover over the toolbar icons for tooltips.</li>
    <li>There is a new status bar at the bottom of the window; look out for feedback and helpful hints here.</li>
    <li>The color menu now only contains the color schemes; the other settings from this menu have been moved to the new Settings menu.</li>
    <li>You can quickly toggle between color-by-residue and color-by-conservation modes using the keyboard shortcut 't'.</li>
    <li>The 'toggle last palette' menu option has been removed because its original purpose (of being able to switch back to a custom color scheme) was not clear. There is now a 'custom' entry in the color scheme sub-menu that you can use for this purpose.  (Note that this only applies to color-by-residue mode.)</li>
    <li>There are some new keyboard shortcuts - see the <a href="belvu_quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> for details.</li>
    <li>You can now control the text size of the alignments using the zoom buttons on the toolbar.  You can change the text size of the menus using the <code>BELVU_FONT_SIZE</code> environment variable (e.g. <code>setenv BELVU_FONT_SIZE 14</code>).  NB To change the font size for all GTK applications, use the <code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code> file instead (e.g. <code>gtk-font-name="sans serif 14"</code>).</li>
    <li>You can now search for an alignment by name using the Find button on the toolbar (or the Ctrl-F shortcut key).</li>
    <li>You can "tear off" drop-down menus using the dotted line at the top.</li>
    <li>You now get a different cursor when you are in the remove-many-sequences mode, rather than a dialog box that you must close to exit the mode; you can now exit this mode by deselecting the option in the toolbar or menu; by pressing the 'Esc' key; or by left-clicking anywhere in the alignment window.</li>
    <li>When you edit the alignment, the tree becomes invalidated and must be recalculated using the 'Recalculate tree' option on the File menu or right-click menu.</li>
    <li>If you change a tree by clicking a branch to swap nodes/re-root the tree, then the current tree window will be updated (rather than creating a new tree window, as in the old Belvu).  If the alignment is sorted by tree order, then it will be updated to reflect the new tree.  To revert to the original tree, you can recalculate it using the 'Recalculate tree' option on the File menu or right-click menu.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>There have also been a few bug fixes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Belvu used to crash when closing a tree when more that one tree window had been opened.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the lower portion of the edit-residue-colours dialog used to crash Belvu.</li>
    <li>There was a bug with the similarity calculation when the sequence contains characters that are not residues; scores for the characters B, X and * are now taken from the BLOSUM62 matrix, and other characters are treated as 'X'.</li>
    <li>A bug has been fixed where the branch order for tree branches of the same length was arbitrary; there was also a bug when saving a tree in New Hampshire format where branch lengths were slightly wrong due to being rounded incorrectly.</li>
  </ul>
