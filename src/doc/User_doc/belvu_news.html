<h1>Belvu - Release History</h1>

  <h3>v4.4</h3>
  <p>Belvu's graphical user interface has been re-vamped.  The changes are mostly cosmetic and should be intuitive, although there are a few points worth noting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The functionality to left-click a menu to get a default action has been removed; left- or right-clicking a menu will now always show the drop-down menu.  The default left-click actions have been moved to a toolbar adjacent to the menu; hover over the toolbar icons for tooltips.</li>
    <li>There is a new status bar at the bottom of the window; look out for feedback and helpful hints here.</li>
    <li>The color menu now only contains the color schemes; the other settings from this menu have been moved to the new Settings menu.</li>
    <li>You can quickly toggle between the color-by-residue and color-by-conservation modes by selecting the relevant option on the Settings menu, or by hitting the keyboard shortcut 't'.</li>
    <li>The 'toggle last palette' function has been removed because its original purpose (of being able to switch back to a custom color scheme) was not clear. There is now a 'custom' entry in the color scheme sub-menu that you can use for this purpose.  (Note that this only applies to color-by-residue mode.)</li>
    <li>There are some new keyboard shortcuts - see the <a href="belvu_quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> for details.</li>
    <li>You can "tear off" drop-down menus using the dotted line at the top.</li>
  </ul>
