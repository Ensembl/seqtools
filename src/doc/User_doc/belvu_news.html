<h1>Belvu - Release History</h1>

  <h3>v4.2</h3>
  <p>Belvu's graphical user interface has been re-vamped.  The changes are mostly cosmetic and should be intuitive, although there are a few points worth noting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The functionality to left-click a menu to get a default action has been removed; left- or right-clicking a menu will now always show the drop-down menu.  The default left-click actions have been moved to a toolbar adjacent to the menu; hover over the toolbar icons for tooltips.</li>
    <li>There is a new status bar at the bottom of the window; look out for feedback and helpful hints here.</li>
    <li>The color schemes have been moved into sub-menus to save space on the main Color menu.  Instead, there are 'by residue' and 'by conservation' entries on the Color menu which indicate the current color mode.  You can quickly toggle between color modes by selecting one of these menu items.</li>
    <li>You can also quickly toggle between the color-by-residue and color-by-conservation modes by selecting the 'Toggle color schemes' option on the Color menu or by hitting the keyboard shortcut 't'.</li>
    <li>The 'toggle last palette' function has been removed because its original purpose (of being able to switch back to a custom color scheme) was not clear. There is now a 'custom' entry in the color scheme sub-menu that you can use for this purpose.  (Note that this only applies to color-by-residue mode.)</li>
    <li>There are some new keyboard shortcuts - see the <a href="belvu_quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> for details.</li>
  </ul>
