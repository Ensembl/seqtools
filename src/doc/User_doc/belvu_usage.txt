  Belvu - View multiple alignments in good-looking colours.
  
  Usage: belvu [options] <multiple_alignment>|- [X options]
  
    <multiple_alignment>|- = alignment file or pipe.
  
  Options:
   -c          Print Conservation table.
   -l <file>   Load residue color code file.
   -L <file>   Load markup and organism color code file.
   -m <file>   Read file with matching sequence segments.
   -r          Read alignment in 'raw' format (Name sequence).
   -R          Do not parse coordinates when reading alignment.
   -o <format> Write alignment or tree to stdout in this format and exit.
                 Valid formats: MSF, Mul(Stockholm), Selex, 
                 FastaAlign, Fasta, tree.
   -X <#>      Print UPGMA-based subfamilies at cutoff #.
   -n <cutoff> Make non-redundant to <cutoff> %identity at startup.
   -Q <cutoff> Remove columns more gappy than <cutoff>.
   -q <cutoff> Remove sequences more gappy than <cutoff>.
   -G          Penalize gaps in pairwise comparisons.
   -i          Ignore gaps in conservation calculation.
   -P          Remove partial sequences at startup.
   -C          Don't write coordinates to saved file.
   -z <char>   Separator char between name and coordinates in saved file.
   -a          Show alignment annotations on screen (Stockholm format only).
   -p          Output random model probabilites for HMMER.
               (Based on all residues.)
   -S <order>  Sort sequences in this order.
                 a -> alphabetically
                 o -> by Swissprot organism, alphabetically
                 s -> by score
                 n -> by Neighbor-joining tree
                 u -> by UPGMA tree
                 S -> by similarity to first sequence
                 i -> by identity to first sequence
   -s <file>   Read in file of scores.
   -T <method> Tree options:
                 i -> Start up showing tree
                 I -> Start up showing only tree
                 d -> Show distances in tree
                 n -> Neighbor-joining
                 u -> UPGMA
                 c -> Don't color tree by organism
                 o -> Don't display sequence coordinates in tree
                 b -> Use Scoredist distance correction (default)
                 j -> Use Jukes-Cantor distance correction
                 k -> Use Kimura distance correction
                 s -> Use Storm & Sonnhammer distance correction
                 r -> Use uncorrected distances
                 p -> Print distance matrix and exit
                 R -> Read distance matrix instead of alignment
               (only in combination with Tree routines)
   -b <#>      Apply boostrap analysis with # bootstrap samples
   -B          Print out bootstrap trees and exit
   (Negative value -> display bootstrap trees on screen)
   -O <label>  Read organism info after this label (default OS)
   -t <title>  Set window title.
   -g          Draw grid line (for debugging).
   -u          Start up with uncoloured alignment (faster).
  
  Some X options:
   -acefont <font>   Main font.
   -font    <font>   Menu font.
  
  Note: X options only work after "setenv POSIXLY_CORRECT"
  
  setenv BELVU_FETCH to desired sequence fetching program.
