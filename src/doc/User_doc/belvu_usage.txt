 Belvu - View multiple alignments in good-looking colours.

 Usage: belvu [options] <multiple_alignment>|- [X options]

   <multiple_alignment>|- = alignment file or pipe.

 Options:
  -c          Print Conservation table.
  -l <file>   Load residue color code file.
  -L <file>   Load markup and organism color code file.
  -m <file>   Read file with matching sequence segments.
  -r          Read alignment in 'raw' format (Name sequence).
  -R          Do not parse coordinates when reading alignment.
  -o <format> Write alignment or tree to stdout in this format and exit.
                Valid formats: MSF, Mul(Stockholm), Selex, 
                FastaAlign, Fasta, tree.
  -X <cutoff> Print UPGMA-based subfamilies at cutoff <cutoff>.
  -n <cutoff> Make non-redundant to <cutoff> %identity at startup.
  -Q <cutoff> Remove columns more gappy than <cutoff>.
  -q <cutoff> Remove sequences more gappy than <cutoff>.
  -G          Penalize gaps in pairwise comparisons.
  -i          Ignore gaps in conservation calculation.
  -P          Remove partial sequences at startup.
  -C          Don't write coordinates to saved file.
  -z <char>   Separator char between name and coordinates in saved file.
  -a          Show alignment annotations on screen (Stockholm format only).
  -p          Output random model probabilites for HMMER.
              (Based on all residues.)
  -S <order>  Sort sequences in this order.
                a -> alphabetically
                o -> by Swissprot organism, alphabetically
                s -> by score
                n -> by Neighbor-joining tree
                u -> by UPGMA tree
                S -> by similarity to first sequence
                i -> by identity to first sequence
  -s <file>   Read in file of scores.
  -T <method> Tree options:
                i -> Start up showing tree
                I -> Start up showing only tree
                d -> Show distances in tree
                n -> Neighbor-joining
                u -> UPGMA
                c -> Don't color tree by organism
                o -> Don't display sequence coordinates in tree
                b -> Use Scoredist distance correction (default)
                j -> Use Jukes-Cantor distance correction
                k -> Use Kimura distance correction
                s -> Use Storm & Sonnhammer distance correction
                r -> Use uncorrected distances
                p -> Print distance matrix and exit
                R -> Read distance matrix instead of alignment
              (only in combination with Tree routines)
  -b <n>      Apply boostrap analysis with <n> bootstrap samples
  -B          Print out bootstrap trees and exit
              (Negative value -> display bootstrap trees on screen)
  -O <label>  Read organism info after this label (default OS)
  -t <title>  Set window title.
  -g          Draw grid line (for debugging).
  -u          Start up with uncoloured alignment (faster).
  -h, --help  Show this usage information
  --compiled  Show package compile date
  --version   Show package version number

 Some X options:
  -acefont <font>   Main font.
  -font    <font>   Menu font.

 Note: X options only work after "setenv POSIXLY_CORRECT"

 setenv BELVU_FETCH to desired sequence fetching program.
 setenv BELVU_FONT_SIZE to specify window font size.
