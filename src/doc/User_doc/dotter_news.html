  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>v4.1.5</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Dotter re-vamp</b>: Dotter has been re-written to facilitate future improvements.  Most of the changes so far are under-the-hood, but you will notice a few cosmetic differences and additional shortcuts.</li>
    <li><b>Menu bar</b>: As well as the right-click menu, there is now a menu-bar at the top of the main Dotter window.</li>
    <li><b>CDS/UTR regions</b>: Exons are now separated into CDS and UTR regions: CDS regions are coloured green and UTR red.</li>
    <li><b>Close all sub-Dotters</b>: You can close all related Dotter windows using the Quit menu option or Ctrl-Q.  This will close all sub-Dotters that were started under the same parent Dotter (by middle-dragging to zoom in to a region).  To just close an individual Dotter window, click on the x in the corner of the window or use your system shortcut for closing a window (e.g. Ctrl-W, or Cmd-W on Macs).  Note that the alignment tool and greyramp tool will be destroyed along with their parent - however, if the parent window is still open then these tools can be re-opened using the relevant menu options or keyboard shortcuts.</li>
    <li><b>Close all Dotters from Blixem</b>: All Dotter windows spawned from a Blixem will be closed when that Blixem is closed.</li>
    <li><b>Navigation keys</b>: You no longer need to hold Shift when moving diagonally along an alignment using the keys ',.[]'. You can hold down Shift to move a single nucleotide at a time along a protein sequence, rather than moving a whole amino-acid.</li>
    <li><b>Keyboard shortcuts</b>: The following keyboard shortcuts have been added to show the Alignment tool, main Dotter window or Greyramp tool, respectively: Ctrl-A, Ctrl-D and Ctrl-G.</li>
    <li><b>Settings dialog</b>: The Parameter Control dialog box has been replaced by a more intuitive Settings dialog.  From here you can change the zoom or edit the display range.</li>
  </ul>
