  </ul>
  <br/>
  <li>Belvu
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the last column not being fully shown.
    <li>Fixed a bug with columns not being resized correctly after deleting sequences.
    <li>Made sure all terminal messages are terminated with a line break.

    <li>Fixed an issue where user could not re-select the sort-by-similarity/id option after changing the selection.
    <li>Added a fix to make sure tree cannot get so large that it causes a crash.
    <li>Fixed a bug with sorting by similarity on start up when the first line is a markup line.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Version 4.4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blixem
  <ul>
    <li>There is a new --zoom-range argument, which allows the caller to specify the initial big picture range.
    <li>Reference sequence coordinates can now be specified in the FASTA definition line in the sequence file; the line format must be:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>>name start end</code>
    <li>Fixed a bug where introns that are partially out of range were not being shown.
    <li>Fixed a bug where short reads were incorrectly being squashed onto the same line in 'squash matches' mode when their sources are different.
    <li>Fixed a bug where the initial exon view height was sometimes being calculated incorrectly.
    <li>Fixed a bug where starting Dotter fails if the fetch command returns a string such as "no match".
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <li>Belvu
  <ul>
    <li>Added Belvu to the SeqTools package.
    <li>The functionality to left-click a menu to get a default action has been removed; left- or right-clicking a menu will now always show the drop-down menu.  The default left-click actions have been moved to a toolbar adjacent to the menu; hover over the toolbar icons for tooltips.
    <li>There is a new status bar at the bottom of the window; look out for feedback and helpful hints here.
    <li>The color menu now only contains the color schemes; the other settings from this menu have been moved to the new Settings menu.
    <li>You can quickly toggle between color-by-residue and color-by-conservation modes using the keyboard shortcut 't'.
    <li>The 'toggle last palette' menu option has been removed because its original purpose (of being able to switch back to a custom color scheme) was not clear. There is now a 'custom' entry in the color scheme sub-menu that you can use for this purpose.  (Note that this only applies to color-by-residue mode.)
    <li>There are some new keyboard shortcuts - see the <a href="belvu_quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> for details.
    <li>You can now control the text size of the alignments using the zoom buttons on the toolbar.  You can change the text size of the menus using the <code>BELVU_FONT_SIZE</code> environment variable (e.g. <code>setenv BELVU_FONT_SIZE 14</code>).  NB To change the font size for all GTK applications, use the <code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code> file instead (e.g. <code>gtk-font-name="sans serif 14"</code>).
    <li>You can now search for an alignment by name using the Find button on the toolbar (or the Ctrl-F shortcut key).
    <li>You can "tear off" drop-down menus using the dotted line at the top.
    <li>You now get a different cursor when you are in the remove-many-sequences mode, rather than a dialog box that you must close to exit the mode; you can now exit this mode by deselecting the option in the toolbar or menu; by pressing the 'Esc' key; or by left-clicking anywhere in the alignment window.
    <li>When you edit the alignment, the tree becomes invalidated and must be recalculated using the 'Recalculate tree' option on the File menu or right-click menu.
    <li>If you change a tree by clicking a branch to swap nodes/re-root the tree, then the current tree window will be updated (rather than creating a new tree window, as in the old Belvu).  If the alignment is sorted by tree order, then it will be updated to reflect the new tree.  To revert to the original tree, you can recalculate it using the 'Recalculate tree' option on the File menu or right-click menu.
  </ul>
</ul>

    <li>Search by column: When grouping or finding sequences, you can now search on data in different columns, not just the Name column.  See the Group and Find dialogs.
    <li>Groups: You can now hide all sequences that are not in a group.  See the Groups dialog.
  </ul>
  <br/>

<h3>Version 4.1.5 </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blixem  
  <ul>
    <li>Close all Dotters: There is a new menu option to close all Dotters started from the current Blixem. Right-click in Blixem to see the menu.
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <li>Dotter
  <ul>
    <li>Dotter re-vamp: Dotter has been re-written to facilitate future improvements.  Most of the changes so far are under-the-hood, but you will notice a few cosmetic differences and additional shortcuts.
    <li>Menu bar: As well as the right-click menu, there is now a menu-bar at the top of the main Dotter window.
    <li>CDS/UTR regions: Exons are now separated into CDS and UTR regions: CDS regions are coloured green and UTR red.
    <li>Close all sub-Dotters: You can close all related Dotter windows using the Quit menu option or Ctrl-Q.  This will close all sub-Dotters that were started under the same parent Dotter (by middle-dragging to zoom in to a region).  To just close an individual Dotter window, click on the x in the corner of the window or use your system shortcut for closing a window (e.g. Ctrl-W, or Cmd-W on Macs).  Note that the alignment tool and greyramp tool will be destroyed along with their parent - however, if the parent window is still open then these tools can be re-opened using the relevant menu options or keyboard shortcuts.
    <li>Close all Dotters from Blixem: All Dotter windows spawned from a Blixem will be closed when that Blixem is closed.
    <li>Navigation keys: You no longer need to hold Shift when moving diagonally along an alignment using the keys ',.[]'. You can hold down Shift to move a single nucleotide at a time along a protein sequence, rather than moving a whole amino-acid.
    <li>Keyboard shortcuts: The following keyboard shortcuts have been added to show the Alignment tool, main Dotter window or Greyramp tool, respectively: Ctrl-A, Ctrl-D and Ctrl-G.
    <li>Settings dialog: The Parameter Control dialog box has been replaced by a more intuitive Settings dialog.  From here you can change the zoom or edit the display range.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Version 4.1.4 </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blixem
  <ul>
    <li>Variations: SNPs, insertions, deletions etc. can be highlighted in the reference sequence, and shown in a 'variations track' above the reference sequence. See the Settings dialog or double-click the reference sequence to show/hide the variations track. Double-click a variation to open its URL. This is an experimental feature and the display is quite crude - please give us feedback on how you would like variations to be displayed, particularly where they overlap.
    <li>PolyA tails: PolyA tails can be shown and polyA signals highlighted in the reference sequence. See the Settings dialog.
    <li>CDS/UTR regions: Exons are now separated into CDS and UTR regions: CDS regions are coloured green and UTR red. Don't forget, you can quickly bump/un-bump the exon view by pressing 'b'.
    <li>Moused-over item feedback: There is now an additional feedback area on the toolbar that shows information about the currently moused-over item.
    <li>Status bar: There is now a status bar at the bottom of the window, which shows non-critical messages and warnings.
    <li>Grid scale: The grid scale now has a finer level of granularity; you can set %ID per cell to as low as 0.1 (see the Settings dialog).
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <li>Dotter
  <ul>
    <li>New Dotter: Dotter has had a re-vamp - check the Dotter Help page for more info.
  </ul>
</ul>
