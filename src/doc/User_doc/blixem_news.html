<h1>Blixem - Release History</h1>

  <h2>v4.1.5</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Close all Dotters</b>: There is a new menu option to close all Dotters started from the current Blixem. Right-click in Blixem to see the menu.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>v4.1.4</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Variations</b>: SNPs, insertions, deletions etc. can be highlighted in the reference sequence, and shown in a 'variations track' above the reference sequence. See the Settings dialog or double-click the reference sequence to show/hide the variations track. Double-click a variation to open its URL. This is an experimental feature and the display is quite crude - please give us feedback on how you would like variations to be displayed, particularly where they overlap.</li>
    <li><b>PolyA tails</b>: PolyA tails can be shown and polyA signals highlighted in the reference sequence. See the Settings dialog.</li>
    <li><b>CDS/UTR regions</b>: Exons are now separated into CDS and UTR regions: CDS regions are coloured green and UTR red. Don't forget, you can quickly bump/un-bump the exon view by pressing 'b'.</li>
    <li><b>Moused-over item feedback</b>: There is now an additional feedback area on the toolbar that shows information about the currently moused-over item.</li>
    <li><b>Status bar</b>: There is now a status bar at the bottom of the window, which shows non-critical messages and warnings.</li>
    <li><b>Grid scale</b>: The grid scale now has a finer level of granularity; you can set %ID per cell to as low as 0.1 (see the Settings dialog).</li>
    <li><b>New Dotter</b>: Dotter has had a re-vamp - check the Dotter Help page for more info.</li>
