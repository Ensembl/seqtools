--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is part of the SeqTools distribution and not part of the external
library package installed here. It is a decriptive placeholder for our git
repository.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SeqTools now has a dependency on the gbtools common library code used for all of
our applications.

The SeqTools build expects to find the gbtools code/makefiles etc, either installed
locally or in the subdirectory src/gbtools. The build will fail unless this is so.

You can either copy the files/subdirectories of gbtools into src/gbtools
yourself or you can run SeqTools's autogen.sh bootstrap script with the "-g"
flag. The latter will copy the current develop branch of gbtools into
src/gbtools.

Alternatively, if you have a checkout of gbtools that you have installed
locally then you can point the seqtools build to use that by setting these flags
when you call runconfig (this will only work if you have NOT copied gbtools
into the src subdirectory):
   
   ../../runconfig LDFLAGS="-L<INSTALL_DIR>/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I<INSTALL_DIR>/include
