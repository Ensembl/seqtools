SeqTools now has a dependency on the gbtools common library code used for all of
our applications.

The SeqTools build expects to find the gbtools code/makefiles etc, either installed
locally or in the subdirectory src/gbtools. The build will fail unless this is so.

Alternatively, if you have a checkout of gbtools that you have installed
locally then you can point the seqtools build to use that by setting these flags
when you call runconfig (this will only work if you have NOT copied gbtools
into the src subdirectory):
   
   ../../runconfig LDFLAGS="-L<INSTALL_DIR>/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I<INSTALL_DIR>/include
